Probability Notes
Topics: Mutually Exclusive, Non-Mutually Exclusive, Independent, and Dependent Events

1. Mutually Exclusive Events = Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.
That is, occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of the other.

Mathematical Definition:
If A and B are two events, then
[
P(A \cap B) = 0
]

Addition Rule (Mutually Exclusive):
[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
]

Example:
When rolling a die,

Event A = getting an even number = {2, 4, 6}
Event B = getting an odd number = {1, 3, 5}
Since A and B cannot happen together, they are mutually exclusive.
[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = 1
]

2. Non-Mutually Exclusive Events = Two events are non-mutually exclusive if they can occur at the same time.

Mathematical Definition:
[
P(A \cap B) \neq 0
]

Addition Rule (Non-Mutually Exclusive):
[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
]

Example:
When drawing a card from a deck:

Event A = drawing a red card
Event B = drawing a king
There are two red kings (‚ô•, ‚ô¶) that belong to both A and B.
[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = \frac{26}{52} + \frac{4}{52} - \frac{2}{52} = \frac{28}{52}
]

3. Independent Events = Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.

Mathematical Definition:
[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
]

Multiplication Rule (Independent):
[
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
]

Example:
When tossing a coin and rolling a die:

Event A = getting a Head = ¬Ω
Event B = getting a 4 = 1/6
[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{12}
]

Diagram:

A and B are separate circles (no influence)

4. Dependent Events = Two events are dependent if the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other.

Mathematical Definition:
[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)
]
Where ( P(B|A) ) = Probability of B given that A has already occurred.

Multiplication Rule (Dependent):
[
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)
]

Example:
Drawing two cards without replacement from a deck:

Event A = first card is King ‚Üí ( P(A) = 4/52 )
Event B = second card is King (after one King removed) ‚Üí ( P(B|A) = 3/51 )
[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{12}{2652} = \frac{1}{221}
]
