📊 What is Statistics?

Definition: Statistics is the branch of mathematics concerned with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

It helps in converting raw data into meaningful information.

🔹 Applications of Statistics

Business & Economics – Market analysis, demand forecasting, quality control.
Science & Engineering – Designing experiments, reliability testing, machine learning.
Medicine – Clinical trials, drug testing, disease predictions.
Government & Policy – Census, surveys, public health analysis.
Education – Student performance analysis, research studies.

📌 Example:

Suppose we want to analyze exam marks of 1000 students.

With statistics → we can compute average marks, top performers, and overall trend.
