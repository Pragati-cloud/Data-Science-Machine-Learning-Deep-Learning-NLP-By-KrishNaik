# 📊 Types of Statistics

Statistics can be divided into **two major categories**:

---

## 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

* Deals with **summarizing and describing** data.
* Methods:

  * Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
  * Measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation)
  * Graphical methods (charts, histograms, box plots)

**Example:**
Heights of 50 students →

* Mean height = 165 cm
* Standard deviation = 10 cm

---

## 2️⃣ Inferential Statistics

* Deals with **drawing conclusions or predictions** about a population using a sample.
* Involves:

  * Hypothesis testing
  * Confidence intervals
  * Regression & correlation

**Example:**

* A survey of 200 voters (sample) is used to predict the outcome of an election (population).
