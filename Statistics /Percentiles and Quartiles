📊 Percentiles and Quartiles

Percentile
A value below which a given percentage of observations fall.
Example: 90th percentile = score below which 90% of data lies.

Formula (position):
[
P_k = \frac{k(N+1)}{100}
]

Quartiles
Divide data into four equal parts.
Q1 (25%), Q2 (Median, 50%), Q3 (75%).
Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 – Q1
📌 Example:

Data = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80}

Q1 = 25th percentile = 25
Q2 = Median = 45
Q3 = 75th percentile = 65
IQR = 65 – 25 = 40
