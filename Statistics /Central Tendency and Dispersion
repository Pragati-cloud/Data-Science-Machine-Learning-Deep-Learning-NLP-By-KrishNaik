📊 Central Tendency and Dispersion
Central Tendency

Measures that indicate the center/average of the data.

Mean:
[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
]

Example: {2, 4, 6, 8} → Mean = 5

Median: Middle value when data is arranged.
Example: {5, 7, 8, 10, 12} → Median = 8

Mode: Most frequent value.
Example: {2, 3, 3, 5, 7} → Mode = 3

Dispersion

Measures of how spread out the data is.

Range = Max – Min
Variance = Average squared deviation from mean
Standard Deviation (SD) = √Variance
IQR (Interquartile Range) = Q3 – Q1
📌 Example:

Data = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

Mean = 30
Range = 50 – 10 = 40
Variance = 200
SD = √200 ≈ 14.14

   Spread of Data → Low dispersion (values close to mean)
                  → High dispersion (values spread out)
