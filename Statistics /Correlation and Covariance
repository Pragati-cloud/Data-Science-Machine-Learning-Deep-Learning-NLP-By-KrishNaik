📊 Correlation and Covariance

* Covariance
Measures how two variables change together.

Formula:
[
\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n-1}
]

* Correlation
A standardized measure of relationship between two variables.

Formula:
[
r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
]

📌 Example:

X = {1, 2, 3}, Y = {2, 4, 6}

Perfect positive correlation (r = +1).

📊 Interpretation of r
r = +1 → Perfect positive relation
r = 0 → No relation
r = -1 → Perfect negative relation
