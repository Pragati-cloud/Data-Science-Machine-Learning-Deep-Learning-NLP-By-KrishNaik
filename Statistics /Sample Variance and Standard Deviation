📊 Sample Variance and Standard Deviation
Sample Variance (s²)

[
s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}
]

(x_i) = data values
(\bar{x}) = sample mean
(n) = sample size
Sample Standard Deviation (s)

[
s = \sqrt{s^2}
]

📌 Example:

Data = {2, 4, 6}

Mean = 4
Variance = (\frac{(2-4)^2 + (4-4)^2 + (6-4)^2}{3-1})
= (\frac{4+0+4}{2} = 4)
Standard Deviation = √4 = 2
