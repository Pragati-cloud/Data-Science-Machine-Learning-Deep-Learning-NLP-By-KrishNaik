# 📊 Population and Sample

---

## Population

* The **entire group** of individuals, items, or data under study.
* Example: All students in a university.

## Sample

* A **subset of the population** used for analysis.
* Example: 200 students selected from the university.

## 📌 Key Point

We use **samples** because studying the whole population is often **impractical, costly, and time-consuming**.
