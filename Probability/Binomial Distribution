# ðŸ“˜ Binomial Distribution

ðŸ”¹ Definition

The Binomial Distribution represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success `p`.

Example: Tossing a coin `n` times and counting how many times we get heads.

ðŸ”¹ Probability Mass Function (PMF)

[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}
]

| Symbol    | Meaning                              |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------- |
| ( n )     | Number of trials                     |
| ( k )     | Number of successes                  |
| ( p )     | Probability of success in each trial |
| ( 1 - p ) | Probability of failure               |

 ðŸ”¹ Mean, Median, Mode, Variance

| Measure            | Formula                                    |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Mean               | ( \mu = n p )                              |
| Variance           | ( \sigma^2 = n p (1 - p) )                 |
| Standard Deviation | ( \sigma = \sqrt{n p (1 - p)} )            |
| Mode               | ( \text{Mode} = \lfloor (n + 1)p \rfloor ) |
| Median (approx.)   | ( \text{Median} \approx n p )              |

 ðŸ”¹ Example

If a coin (p = 0.5) is tossed 5 times, find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads.

[
P(X = 3) = \binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^2 = 10 \times 0.125 \times 0.25 = 0.3125
]

ðŸ”¹ Key Properties

* Trials are independent.
* Only two outcomes per trial (success/failure).
* Fixed number of trials.
