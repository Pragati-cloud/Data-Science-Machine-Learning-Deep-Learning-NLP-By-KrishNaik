üìà Probability Distributions ‚Äî PMF, PDF, and CDF

1. Introduction

In probability theory, a random variable (X) represents numerical outcomes of random phenomena.
It can be discrete or continuous, and its probability behavior is described by three main functions:

PMF ‚Üí for discrete random variables
PDF ‚Üí for continuous random variables
CDF ‚Üí cumulative probability for both types

2. Probability Mass Function (PMF)
Definition = A Probability Mass Function (PMF) gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes a specific value.

Formula:
P(X = x_i) = p(x_i)

where

X = random variable
x·µ¢ = specific value
p(x·µ¢) = probability that X = x·µ¢
Properties
0 ‚â§ p(x·µ¢) ‚â§ 1
Œ£ p(x·µ¢) = 1
Example

Let X = number of heads in two coin tosses.

X	Outcome	P(X)
0	TT	1/4
1	HT, TH	2/4
2	HH	1/4

Hence:
P(X = 0) = 1/4, P(X = 1) = 1/2, P(X = 2) = 1/4

3. Probability Density Function (PDF)
Definition = A Probability Density Function (PDF) applies to continuous random variables.
It shows how probability is distributed across continuous values.

Formula (interval probability):
P(a ‚â§ X ‚â§ b) = ‚à´ from a to b of f(x) dx

Properties
f(x) ‚â• 0
‚à´ from -‚àû to +‚àû of f(x) dx = 1
For continuous variables, P(X = x) = 0
Example

If

f(x) = x/2   for  0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 2
       0     otherwise

the
P(1 ‚â§ X ‚â§ 2) = ‚à´ from 1 to 2 of (x/2) dx = 3/4

4. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
Definition = A Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) gives the probability that X is less than or equal to a certain value.

Formula:
F(x) = P(X ‚â§ x)


For discrete X:
F(x) = Œ£ (for t ‚â§ x) P(X = t)


For continuous X:
F(x) = ‚à´ from -‚àû to x of f(t) dt

Properties
0 ‚â§ F(x) ‚â§ 1
F(-‚àû) = 0, F(‚àû) = 1
F(x) is non-decreasing
Example (Discrete)

Using the previous coin toss PMF:

X	P(X)	F(X) = P(X ‚â§ x)
0	1/4	1/4
1	1/2	3/4
2	1/4	1.0

5. Comparison of PMF, PDF, and CDF
Function	Variable Type	Represents	Formula	Total Probability	Graph Type	Example
PMF	Discrete	P(X = x)	Œ£ p(x) = 1	1	Step/Bar	Dice, coin toss
PDF	Continuous	f(x), probability density	‚à´ f(x) dx = 1	1	Smooth curve	Height, weight
CDF	Both	P(X ‚â§ x)	Œ£ p(x) or ‚à´ f(x)	1	Increasing curve	Score ‚â§ x

6. Visual Comparison
PMF ‚Üí Shows probability at each discrete value.
PDF ‚Üí Shows probability density over a range.
CDF ‚Üí Accumulates probability up to a given point.

7. Real-Life Examples
Concept	Example	Explanation
PMF	Rolling a die	Each face (1‚Äì6) has equal probability 1/6
PDF	Height of people	Probability that height lies between 160‚Äì170 cm
CDF	Exam scores	Probability that a student scores ‚â§ 70 marks

üß© Summary
PMF: Discrete ‚Üí P(X = x)
PDF: Continuous ‚Üí f(x), use area under curve
CDF: Cumulative probability up to x
Total probability = 1 for all cases
