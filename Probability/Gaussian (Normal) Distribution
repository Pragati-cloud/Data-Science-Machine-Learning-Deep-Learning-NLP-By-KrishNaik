# ðŸ“™ Gaussian (Normal) Distribution

ðŸ”¹ Definition

The Normal Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about its mean. It describes many natural phenomena such as height, IQ, and measurement errors.

 ðŸ”¹ Properties

* Bell-shaped and symmetric about the mean.
* Total area under the curve = 1.
* 68% of data lies within Â±1Ïƒ, 95% within Â±2Ïƒ, 99.7% within Â±3Ïƒ.

| Range               | % of Data |
| :------------------ | :-------- |
| ( \mu \pm 1\sigma ) | 68%       |
| ( \mu \pm 2\sigma ) | 95%       |
| ( \mu \pm 3\sigma ) | 99.7%     |

 ðŸ”¹ Example

If IQ scores are normally distributed with mean ( \mu = 100 ) and ( \sigma = 15 ),
find the probability that a person has an IQ between 85 and 115.

[
Z_1 = \frac{85 - 100}{15} = -1, \quad Z_2 = \frac{115 - 100}{15} = 1
]

From Z-table:
[
P(-1 < Z < 1) = 0.6826
]

Hence, **68.26%** of people have IQ between 85 and 115.
