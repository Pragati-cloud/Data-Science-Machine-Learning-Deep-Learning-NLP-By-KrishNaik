🎯 Bernoulli Distribution — Statistics Notes (GitHub Friendly)

1. Introduction = A Bernoulli Distribution is the simplest form of a discrete probability distribution.
It describes the outcome of a single experiment that has only two possible outcomes:

Success (1) → with probability p
Failure (0) → with probability q = 1 - p

It is used to model experiments such as:

Tossing a coin (Head or Tail)
Pass/Fail in an exam
Win/Lose in a game

2. Probability Distribution Function (PMF)
For a Bernoulli random variable X, the Probability Mass Function (PMF) is:

P(X = x) = p^x * (1 - p)^(1 - x) , where x = 0 or 1

X	Outcome	Probability
0	Failure	1 - p
1	Success	p

Condition:
0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and (p + q) = 1

3. Mean, Variance, Median, and Mode
➤ Mean (Expected Value)
E(X) = p

➤ Variance
Var(X) = p * (1 - p)

➤ Standard Deviation
SD(X) = √[p * (1 - p)]

➤ Median
If 0 < p < 1 → Median = 0 or 1
(If p = 0.5, both 0 and 1 are medians)

➤ Mode
Mode = 1 if p > 0.5
Mode = 0 if p < 0.5


(If p = 0.5, both 0 and 1 are modes)

4. Example
Suppose you toss a fair coin.

Let:
Success = getting a Head → p = 0.5
Failure = getting a Tail → q = 1 - p = 0.5

X	Outcome	Probability
0	Tail	0.5
1	Head	0.5

Now calculate:

Mean = p = 0.5
Variance = p * (1 - p) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25
Standard Deviation = √0.25 = 0.5
Median = 0 or 1
Mode = both 0 and 1 (since p = 0.5)

6. Properties of Bernoulli Distribution
Property	Formula / Value	Description
Type	Discrete	Two possible outcomes
Parameters	p (probability of success)	0 ≤ p ≤ 1
Mean	E(X) = p	Expected success rate
Variance	Var(X) = p(1 - p)	Spread of data
Mode	1 (if p > 0.5) or 0 (if p < 0.5)	Most frequent value
Median	0 or 1	Central point
Range of X	0, 1	Only two possible values

7. Real-Life Examples
Scenario	Success (1)	Failure (0)	Probability (p)
Coin toss	Head	Tail	0.5
Exam result	Pass	Fail	0.7
Quality control	Defective	Non-defective	0.1

8. Relationship with Binomial Distribution
A Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the Binomial distribution with
n = 1
That is, Binomial(n=1, p) ≡ Bernoulli(p)

9. Summary
Measure	Formula	Description
Mean	p	Expected success probability
Variance	p(1 - p)	Measure of spread
SD	√[p(1 - p)]	Spread in same units as X
Median	0 or 1	Middle value
Mode	1 if p > 0.5, else 0	Most frequent outcome

Key Takeaway: Bernoulli Distribution models a single trial with binary outcomes — it forms the foundation for many statistical and machine learning concepts such as logistic regression and binomial models.
